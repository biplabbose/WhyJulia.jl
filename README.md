# WhyJulia.jl

> *Because even equations need comic relief.*

**WhyJulia.jl** is an Easter-egg package for Julia inspired by MATLAB’s legendary `why()` function.  
Every time you call `why()`, it prints a random witty statement drawn from math, computing, AI/ML, 
physics, or biology — sometimes profound, often nonsensical, but always entertaining.
